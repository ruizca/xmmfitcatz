XMMFITCAT-Z
-----------
In this repository you can find a collection of Python 2 scripts developed for building the XMMFITCAT-Z, a catalogue of X-ray spectral fits for XMM-Newton sources. See [Ruiz et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202039431) for details about the catalogue.

Be aware that this code is quite old and not mantained anymore. For an updated version of a similar code, see my [bxaagnfitter](https://github.com/ruizca/bxaagnfitter) repository.
