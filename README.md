XMMFITCAT-Z
-----------
In this repository you can find a collection of Python 2 scripts developed for building the XMMFITCAT-Z, a catalogue of X-ray spectral fits for XMM-Newton sources. See [Ruiz et al. 2020]() for details

Be aware that this code is quite old and not mantained anymore. For an updated version of a similar code, see my bxaagnfitter repository.
